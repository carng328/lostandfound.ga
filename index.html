						I am searching for a lady who knows how to treat a man, is affectionate, caring, loving, and loyal. The ideal woman I'm searching for doesn't disappear randomly in between conversations, doesn't change her behavior towards me, maintain consistency, and has no intention of wasting each other's time. She must be marriage minded and serious about lifetime commitment. She must be willing to put effort, able to communicate openly, and unafraid to express herself. I consider myself a gentleman who knows how to treat women, is affectionate, gentle, and loving towards my partner. I do not like disappointing people and I don't like it being done towards me. I do not like ignorant people and I do not judge people by appearances. That being said, as long as you're a kind person with a beautiful heart and knows how to treat a man that is more than enough to earn my love. I am a very reliable person, respectful, and kind hearted. If this is sounds like you, I would love to get to know you :D

						I am searching for a woman that I am extremely unlikely to find on here or generally anywhere else for that matter because I am perfectly aware of how deceiving and selfish women can be but amidst the lack of diversity, I still haven't lost hope that the one I'm searching for is still out there, somewhere, searching for me.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						Basically what I'm searching for is a woman that knows how to treat her man and does everything in her power to put effort and make him happy. A woman who isn't afraid to speak up and communicate or express her feelings because it is important to be aware of the fact that we are not mind readers so it's only fair that we are able to communicate with each other openly to establish and maintain a healthy relationship. I am searching for a woman who is affectionate, caring, loving, and loyal towards her partner. The type that knows how to cook. She must not be a liar or cheater. She must be humble, genuine and kind hearted. She must be considerate, mature, respectful. I would like to meet a woman who believes in true love and loves like she's never been hurt before. I don't want any selfish, shallow or materialistic person in my life. I want real love. I want a girl that isn't easy and that I can take my time getting to know. I want someone who can be my best friend as well as my girlfriend. Many would call this type of woman wife material.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						As for me, I am perhaps the most reliable person you could ever meet. You would literally be able to count on me for anything. I don't like disappointing people and I don't like it being done to me. I've never cheated or lied to a woman I've ever been with or gotten to know. I take honesty very seriously. I don't like ignorance at all and I don't judge people by appearances. If you are a woman with a good heart and equally good intentions that is more than enough to earn my love. I don't discriminate against anyone. I am an affectionate, caring, loving, loyal individual. I don't expect to receive many responses because I am aware this might discourage and intimidate a lot of women but I know what I want in a woman and I am not a cheater. I am serious about love and I would love to meet someone I can spend my entire life with who possesses these beautiful yet rare personal qualities. If you like what you've read and can see yourself with a person like me, I would love to hear from you.

						Please when you respond to my ad please put the words "one woman" in the subject line of your e mail.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I want to meet and hopefully become close with one woman who is warm, loving, intelligent and fun.
						I live in Manhattan, I am a married white male, searching for passion, romance, affection and laughter.
						You should be a non smoker.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I am 5-11, 205, dark hair and green eyes. I am 59 years old.
						I am seeking a woman that can make me happy and one that I can make happy also.
						Passion, sensitivity, intelligence, sense of humor, romance and a strong mental connection are important for us to make this work.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I am passionate about many different things including sports, theater, photography, travel, ethnic dining, classic rock music, live concerts, nature and animals, whale watches, reading and more.
						I am passionate and romantic in the company of a woman. I love to hold hands, kiss, touch and be touched.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						Your age does not matter, I am 59.
						Your marital status does not matter, I am married.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I'm looking for some special chemistry that can bring passion and intimacy into our lives.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I am not looking to change my situation or yours but my life lacks passion and affection and I want to find that now.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I have two adult children and also two cats that are nine years old, but they are not behaving like adults yet :). What can you expect from cats? :)
						<br/>
						<br/>

						If you are a believer in the mentally deranged orange man who is running for President then do not answer my ad. We will never get along.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						I work for myself and have a flexible schedule so I do have the time to spend with the right woman.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						If you are serious about seeking what I am seeking, then please write to me now. I will respond to all real replies. If you do reply please be serious, I want to meet someone, not just exchange e mails. There are so many game players on CL. Please, if you are one of those, I do not want to hear from you.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						Please remember, when you respond please put the words "one woman" in the subject line of your e mail.
						Please, if you respond make it more than one sentence, tell me a little about yourself.

						I am looking for a seriously relationship with a nerdy girl that is seeking a long term commitment.
						come be my player 2, my co-op buddy, my duo queue partner, my rival, friend and lover.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						you don't necessarily have to be super nerdy but if we don't have some hobbies in common i suspect that our relationship won't last too long.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						this is an advertisement for a long term serious relationship so if you are looking for a quick lay that probably wont be happening.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						also, while i recognize personality and attitude are the most important traits to me, sex is also an important quality that enriches great relationships and sometimes even holds terrible relationships together, so for the sake of sexual compatibility im just putting out here that i consider myself dominant in bed and enjoy rough sex, so if you are a little kinky that is a good thing ;)
